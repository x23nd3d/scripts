                        For a long time Starks ruled their area as the kings of the North. But after the invasion of
                        Västerås Eigon I of Targaryen, King Torrchen Stark surrendered when he saw the dragons that
                        Targaryen had brought with him to the battle on the Fiery Field. So Starks received the title of
                        the Supreme Lords of the North and began to serve the king on the Iron Throne as custodians of
                        the North.
                        Three hundred years later, Lord Eddard Stark intermarried with Tully's house by marrying Catelyn
                        Tully. During the uprising of Robert Baratheon, Eddard and his men fought on Robert’s side and
                        helped him ascend the throne.

                        Eddard Stark was arrested for false treason, and then executed. His son, Robb Stark, called a
                        banner to set his father free. After his death, the lords of the North began to think for whom
                        to fight in the war, and realized that they did not want to fight for anyone except the King of
                        the North, as in ancient times. Robb was declared king of the North, North joined the war to
                        avenge Ned and win his independence.

                        Robb Stark's army won a number of victories in the Riverlands, and was joined by the Lords of
                        the Riverlands, who are the vassals of his grandfather, Hoster Tully. The army moved to the
                        territory of the Western lands.

                        and
                        the former royal house of the Seven Kingdoms. House Targaryen conquered and unified the realm
                        before it was deposed during Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal
                        House. The two surviving Targaryens fled into exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the
                        Narrow Sea. House Lannister replaced House Baratheon as the royal House following the
                        destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, but the realm was reconquered by Daenerys Targaryen,
                        retaking the Iron Throne following the Battle of King's Landing. Daenerys's assassination at the
                        hands of Jon Snow, makes him the last living member of House Targaryen, whose identity as the
                        son of Rhaegar Targaryen is kept hidden from Westeros. The bloodline of House Targaryen also
                        still exists in various houses, such as House Baratheon and House Martell.

                        House Targaryen's sigil is a three-headed red dragon on a black background, and their house
                        words are "Fire and Blood."</p>

                        it to House Targaryen. House Baratheon traditionally rules the Stormlands on the eastern coast
                        of Westeros, aptly named for its frequent storms, from their seat of Storm's End.

                        House Baratheon became the royal house of the Seven Kingdoms after Robert Baratheon led a
                        rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty. At the end of the rebellion, Robert ascended the Iron
                        Throne as Robert I and married Cersei Lannister after the death of Lyanna Stark.
                        House Baratheon became extinct after the deaths of Stannis Baratheon and his family, but was
                        revived when Robert's last bastard was legitimized by Queen Daenerys Targaryen as Gendry
                        Baratheon.

                        House Baratheon's sigil is a crowned black stag on a gold background and their house words are

                        after taking control of the region from House Gardener during the Targaryen conquest.

                        The House was formerly led by Lord Mace Tyrell. Mace's son Loras was a noted tournament knight
                        and, secretly, the lover of Lord Renly Baratheon. Mace's daughter Margaery married Renly when he
                        crowned himself king in the War of the Five Kings to cement an alliance between Renly and her
                        father. Following Renly's death, Margaery was then married to King Joffrey Baratheon before his
                        assassination at his wedding feast. She was then married to his younger brother, King Tommen

                        for Daenerys Targaryen in opposition against Cersei Lannister, who had orchestrated the downfall
                        of House Tyrell. With the death of Olenna after the Sack.

                        Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties. It was also the
                        royal house of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing,
                        which had been their puppet house during the War of the Five Kings, for a brief stint of time
                        until House Targaryen took back the Iron Throne in Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros.

                        The Lannisters rule over the Westerlands. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky
                        promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it
                        over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. As
                        the new royal house, they also ruled directly over the Crownlands from their seat of the Red
                        Keep in King's Landing, the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry
                        consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their House words are "Hear me roar!",
                        which are rarely mentioned.[1] Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official
                        one, is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly in
                        negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.</p>

                        rules the peninsula of Dorne in the far south of the continent from their castle Sunspear.
                        Though loyal to the Iron Throne, the Martells were never conquered by the Targaryens and pursued
                        a more isolated role in wider political events since Robert's Rebellion.
                        House Martell's sigil is a red sun pierced by a golden spear, on an orange field, a combination
                        of the original Martell sigil - a yellow spear - and the emblem of Princess Nymeria - a red sun
                        - to symbolize the marriage of the warrior-queen to Mors Martell. Their house words are
                        "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken."

                        Under the leadership of Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, the forces of House Martell and Dorne
                        were aligned to support the cause of Daenerys Targaryen against House Lannister after they
                        declared war against them.
                        Following the deaths of the older Sand Snakes and Ellaria's imprisonment in King's Landing and
                        likely death, an unnamed Martell acquires the lordship of Dorne, becoming its prince.</p>
